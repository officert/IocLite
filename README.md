IocLite
=======

IOC Lite is a lightweight IOC container that can be used in projects that need an internal DI container, as well as the
ability to allow a user to use their own IOC container.

IOC Lite is not a full fledged IOC Container like StructureMap, or Castle Windsor. It is only supports constructor
injection, does not support auto registration and only has a few options for object lifetime management.
